He reportedly had this even while seated and denied overt dizziness.  He reports this lightheadedness is made even worse when standing.  He has had these symptoms almost daily over the past month.  He does report some confusion when he awakens.  He reports that he loses consciousness for two to three minutes.  Denies any bowel or bladder loss, although he reports very little urine output secondary to his end-stage renal disease.  He denied any palpitations, warmth, or diaphoresis, which is indicative of vasovagal syncope.  There were no witnesses to his syncopal episodes.  He also denied any clonic activity and no history of seizures.  In the emergency room, the patient was given fluids and orthostatics were checked.

He reports that over the past month, he has been feeling lightheaded when standing and has had three syncopal episodes during this time with return of consciousness after several minutes.  He reportedly had this even while seated and denied overt dizziness.  He reports this lightheadedness is made even worse when standing.  He has had these symptoms almost daily over the past month.  He does report some confusion when he awakens.  He reports that he loses consciousness for two to three minutes.  Denies any bowel or bladder loss, although he reports very little urine output secondary to his end-stage renal disease.  He denied any palpitations, warmth, or diaphoresis, which is indicative of vasovagal syncope.  There were no witnesses to his syncopal episodes.  He also denied any clonic activity and no history of seizures.  In the emergency room, the patient was given fluids and orthostatics were checked.  At that time, orthostatics were negative; however, due to the fact that fluid had been given before, it is impossible to rule out orthostatic hypotension.  The patient presented to the hospital on Coreg 12.5 mg b.i.d. and lisinopril 10 mg daily secondary to his hypertension, congestive heart failure with dilated cardiomyopathy and end-stage renal disease.  Regarding his syncopal episodes, he was admitted with likely orthostatic hypotension.  Cardiology was consulted and their recommendations were to reduce the lisinopril to 5 mg daily.  At that time, the Coreg had been held secondary to hypotension.  Cardiology also ordered a nuclear medicine myocardial perfusion stress test.  Regarding the end-stage renal disease, Nephrology was consulted as the patient was due for hemodialysis treatment the day following admission.  Nephrology was able to perform dialysis on the patient and Renal concurred that the presyncopal symptoms were likely due to decreased intravascular volume in the postdialytic time frame.  Renal agreed with decreasing his lisinopril to 5 mg daily and decreasing the Coreg to 6.25 mg b.i.d.  They reported that the Procrit should be continued.  As previously indicated regarding the dilated cardiomyopathy, Cardiology ordered a nuclear medicine stress test to be performed.  Also, regarding the patient's hypertension, he actually was noted to have hypotension on admission, and as previously stated, the Coreg was originally discontinued and then it was restarted at 6.25 mg b.i.d. and the patient tolerated this well.  The patient's hospital course remained uncomplicated until September 17, 2007, the day the nuclear medicine stress test was scheduled.  The patient stated that he was reluctant to proceed with the test and he was afraid of needles and the risks associated with the test although the procedure was explained to the patient and the risks of the procedure were quit low, the patient proceeded to discharge himself against medical advice.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS\/MEDICATIONS:,The patient left AMA.  No specific discharge instructions and medications were given.  At the time of the patient leaving AMA, his medications were as follows:,1.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily.,2.

She has made great strides; however, with her receptive communication, she is able to read words as well as short phrases and able to point to named objects and answer simple-to-moderate complex yes-no questions.  A reevaluation completed on 12\/01\/08, revealed an aphasia quotient of 26.4.  Once again, she made significant improvement and comprehension, but continues to have unintelligible speech.  An alternative communication device was discussed with the patient and her husband, but at this time, the patient does not want to utilize a communication device.

At the onset of therapy, on 03\/26\/08, the patient was NPO with a G-tube and the initial speech and language evaluation revealed global aphasia with an aphasia quotient of 3.6\/100 based on the Western Aphasia Battery.  Since the initial evaluation, the patient has attended 60 outpatient speech therapy sessions, which have focussed on her receptive communication, expressive language, multimodality communication skills, and swallowing function and safety.,SHORT-TERM GOALS:,1.  The patient met 3 out of 4 original short-term therapy goals, which were to complete a modified barium swallow study, which she did do and which revealed no aspiration.  At this time, the patient is eating and drinking and taking all medications by mouth; however, her G-tube is still present.  The patient was instructed to talk to the primary care physician about removal of her feeding tube.,2.  The patient will increase accuracy of yes-no responses to greater than 80% accuracy.  She did accomplish this goal.  The patient is also able to identify named objects with greater than 80% accuracy.,ADDITIONAL GOALS: , Following the completion of these goals, additional goals were established.  Based on reevaluation, the patient met 2 out of these 3 initial goals and she is currently able to read and understand simple sentences with greater than 90% accuracy independently and she is able to write 10 words related to basic wants and needs with greater than 80% accuracy independently.  The patient continues to have difficulty stating verbally, yes or no, to questions as well as accurately using head gestures and to respond to yes-no questions.  The patient continues to have marked difficulty with her expressive language abilities.  She is able to write simple words to help express her basic wants and needs.  She has made great strides; however, with her receptive communication, she is able to read words as well as short phrases and able to point to named objects and answer simple-to-moderate complex yes-no questions.  A reevaluation completed on 12\/01\/08, revealed an aphasia quotient of 26.4.  Once again, she made significant improvement and comprehension, but continues to have unintelligible speech.  An alternative communication device was discussed with the patient and her husband, but at this time, the patient does not want to utilize a communication device.  If, in the future, the patient continues to struggle with her expressive communication, an alternative augmented communication device would be a benefit to her.

His sodium was 132, potassium 4.1, chloride 95, CO2 27, BUN of 8 with a creatinine of 0.3.  His bilirubin was 17.1, alk phos 273, AST 104, ALT 136, total protein 7.8 and albumin of 3.8.  He was tolerating a regular diet.  The patient had been on oral hypoglycemics as an outpatient, but in hospital, he was simply managed with an insulin sliding scale.  The patient will be transferred back to Pelican Bay, under the care of Dr. X at the infirmary.  He will be further managed for his diabetes there.  The patient will additionally undergo potential end of life meetings.  I discussed the potentials of chemotherapy with patient.  Certainly, there are modest benefits, which can be obtained with chemotherapy in metastatic pancreatic cancer, though at some cost with morbidity.  The patient will consider this and will discuss this further with Dr. X.  ,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:,1.  Phenergan 25 mg q.6. p.r.n.,2.  Duragesic patch 100 mcg q.3.d.,3.  Benadryl 25-50 mg p.o. q.i.d. for pruritus.,4.  Sliding scale will be discontinued at the time of discharge and will be reinstituted on arrival at Pelican Bay Infirmary.,5.  The patient had initially been on enalapril here.  His hypertension will be managed by Dr. X as well.  ,PLAN: , The patient should return for repeat ERCP if there are signs of stent occlusion such as fever, increased bilirubin, worsening pain.  In the meantime, he will be kept on a regular diet and activity per Dr. X.","114":"ADMITTING DIAGNOSES:,1.  Fever.,2.  Otitis media.,3.  Possible sepsis.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a 10-month-old male who was seen in the office 1 day prior to admission.  He has had a 2-day history of fever that has gone up to as high as 103.6 degrees F. He has also had intermittent cough, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea and no history of rashes.  He has been taking Tylenol and Advil to help decrease the fevers, but the fever has continued to rise.  He was noted to have some increased workup of breathing and parents returned to the office on the day of admission.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant for being born at 33 weeks' gestation with a birth weight of 5 pounds and 1 ounce.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On exam, he was moderately ill appearing and lethargic.  HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Tympanic membranes were red and yellow, and opaque bilaterally.  Nares were patent.  Oropharynx was slightly moist and pink.  Neck was soft and supple without masses.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.  Lungs showed increased workup of breathing, moderate tachypnea.  No rales, rhonchi or wheezes were noted.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Active bowel sounds.  Neurologic exam showed good muscle strength, normal tone.  Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact.,LABORATORY FINDINGS: , He had electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and glucose all of which were within normal limits.  White blood cell count was 8.6 with 61% neutrophils, 21% lymphocytes, 17% monocytes, suggestive of a viral infection.  Urinalysis was completely unremarkable.  Chest x-ray showed a suboptimal inspiration, but no evidence of an acute process in the chest.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The patient was admitted to the hospital and allowed a clear liquid diet.  Activity is as tolerates.  CBC with differential, blood culture, electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine, glucose, UA, and urine culture all were ordered.  Chest x-ray was ordered as well with 2 views to evaluate for a possible pneumonia.  Pulse oximetry checks were ordered every shift and as needed with O2 ordered per nasal cannula if O2 saturations were less that 94%.  Gave D5 and quarter of normal saline at 45 mL per hour, which was just slightly above maintenance rate to help with hydration.  He was given ceftriaxone 500 mg IV once daily to treat otitis media and possible sepsis, and I will add Tylenol and ibuprofen as needed for fevers.  Overnight, he did have his oxygen saturations drop and went into oxygen overnight.  His lungs remained clear, but because of the need for O2, we instituted albuterol aerosols every 6 hours to help maintain good lung function.  The nurses were instructed to attempt to wean O2 if possible and advance the diet.  He was doing clear liquids well and so I saline locked to help to accommodate improve the mobility with the patient.  He did well the following evening with no further oxygen requirement.  He continued to spike fevers but last fever was around 13:45 on the previous day.  At the time of exam, he had 100% oxygen saturations on room air with temperature of 99.3 degrees F. with clear lungs.  He was given additional dose of Rocephin when it was felt that it would be appropriate for him to be discharged that morning.,CONDITION OF THE PATIENT AT DISCHARGE: , He was at 100% oxygen saturations on room air with no further dips at night.

The patient received 3 nebulizers at home without much improvement.  He was subsequently treated successfully with supplemental oxygen provided by normal nasal cannula initially and subsequently changed to BiPAP.,HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,The patient was admitted to the hospitalist service, treated with frequent small volume nebulizers, treated with IV Solu-Medrol and BiPAP support for COPD exacerbation.  The patient also noted with poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with a rate in the low 100s to mid 100s.  The patient subsequently received diltiazem, also received p.o. digoxin.  The patient subsequently responded well as well received IV antibiotics including Levaquin and Zosyn.  The patient made slow, but steady improvement over the course of his hospitalization.  The patient subsequently was able to be weaned off BiPAP during the day, but continued BiPAP at night and will continue with BiPAP if needed.  The patient may require a sleep study after discharge, but by the third day prior to discharge he was no longer utilizing BiPAP, was simply using supplemental O2 at night and was able to maintain appropriate and satisfactory O2 saturations on one-liter per minute supplemental O2 per nasal cannula.  The patient was able to participate with physical therapy, able to ambulate from his bed to the bathroom, and was able to tolerate a dysphagia 2 diet.  Note that speech therapy did provide a consultation during this hospitalization and his modified barium swallow was thought to be unremarkable and really related only to the patient's severe shortness of breath during meal time.  The patient's chest x-ray on admission revealed some mild vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions that appeared to be unchanged.  There was also more pronounced patchy alveolar opacity, which appeared to be, \"mass like\" in the right suprahilar region.  This subsequently resolved and the patient's infiltrate slowly improved over the course of his hospitalization.  On the day prior to discharge, the patient had a chest x-ray 2 views, which allowing for differences in technique revealed little change in the bibasilar infiltrates and atelectatic changes at the bases bilaterally.

The patient received 3 nebulizers at home without much improvement.  He was subsequently treated successfully with supplemental oxygen provided by normal nasal cannula initially and subsequently changed to BiPAP.,HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,The patient was admitted to the hospitalist service, treated with frequent small volume nebulizers, treated with IV Solu-Medrol and BiPAP support for COPD exacerbation.  The patient also noted with poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with a rate in the low 100s to mid 100s.  The patient subsequently received diltiazem, also received p.o. digoxin.  The patient subsequently responded well as well received IV antibiotics including Levaquin and Zosyn.  The patient made slow, but steady improvement over the course of his hospitalization.  The patient subsequently was able to be weaned off BiPAP during the day, but continued BiPAP at night and will continue with BiPAP if needed.  The patient may require a sleep study after discharge, but by the third day prior to discharge he was no longer utilizing BiPAP, was simply using supplemental O2 at night and was able to maintain appropriate and satisfactory O2 saturations on one-liter per minute supplemental O2 per nasal cannula.  The patient was able to participate with physical therapy, able to ambulate from his bed to the bathroom, and was able to tolerate a dysphagia 2 diet.  Note that speech therapy did provide a consultation during this hospitalization and his modified barium swallow was thought to be unremarkable and really related only to the patient's severe shortness of breath during meal time.  The patient's chest x-ray on admission revealed some mild vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions that appeared to be unchanged.  There was also more pronounced patchy alveolar opacity, which appeared to be, \"mass like\" in the right suprahilar region.  This subsequently resolved and the patient's infiltrate slowly improved over the course of his hospitalization.

The patient received 3 nebulizers at home without much improvement.  He was subsequently treated successfully with supplemental oxygen provided by normal nasal cannula initially and subsequently changed to BiPAP.,HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,The patient was admitted to the hospitalist service, treated with frequent small volume nebulizers, treated with IV Solu-Medrol and BiPAP support for COPD exacerbation.  The patient also noted with poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with a rate in the low 100s to mid 100s.  The patient subsequently received diltiazem, also received p.o. digoxin.  The patient subsequently responded well as well received IV antibiotics including Levaquin and Zosyn.  The patient made slow, but steady improvement over the course of his hospitalization.  The patient subsequently was able to be weaned off BiPAP during the day, but continued BiPAP at night and will continue with BiPAP if needed.  The patient may require a sleep study after discharge, but by the third day prior to discharge he was no longer utilizing BiPAP, was simply using supplemental O2 at night and was able to maintain appropriate and satisfactory O2 saturations on one-liter per minute supplemental O2 per nasal cannula.  The patient was able to participate with physical therapy, able to ambulate from his bed to the bathroom, and was able to tolerate a dysphagia 2 diet.  Note that speech therapy did provide a consultation during this hospitalization and his modified barium swallow was thought to be unremarkable and really related only to the patient's severe shortness of breath during meal time.  The patient's chest x-ray on admission revealed some mild vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions that appeared to be unchanged.  There was also more pronounced patchy alveolar opacity, which appeared to be, \"mass like\" in the right suprahilar region.  This subsequently resolved and the patient's infiltrate slowly improved over the course of his hospitalization.  On the day prior to discharge, the patient had a chest x-ray 2 views, which allowing for differences in technique revealed little change in the bibasilar infiltrates and atelectatic changes at the bases bilaterally.

Suspected mild stress-induced adrenal insufficiency.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , This very independent 79-year old had struggled with cough, fevers, weakness, and chills for the week prior to admission.  She was seen on multiple occasions at Urgent Care and in her physician's office.  Initial x-ray showed some mild diffuse patchy infiltrates.  She was first started on Avelox, but had a reaction, switched to Augmentin, which caused loose stools, and then three days prior to admission was given daily 1 g Rocephin and started on azithromycin.

Hospital course was relatively unremarkable.  CT scan was performed and no specific focal pathology was seen.  Dr. X, pulmonologist was consulted.  He also was uncertain as to the exact etiology, but viral etiology was most highly suspected.  Because of her loose stools, C. difficile toxin was ordered, although that is pending at the time of discharge.  She was continued on Rocephin IV and azithromycin.  Her fever broke 18 hours prior to discharge, and O2 saturations improved, as did her overall strength and clinical status.  She was instructed to finish azithromycin.  She has two pills left at home.  She is to follow up with Dr. X in two to three days.  Because she is on chronic prednisone therapy, it was suspected that she was mildly adrenal insufficient from the stress of her pneumonia.  She is to continue the increased dose of prednisone at 20 mg (up from 5 mg per day).  We will consult her rheumatologist as to whether to continue her methotrexate, which we held this past Friday.

The mass increased in size.  She eventually underwent a partial resection found to have pathologic grade 2 leiomyosarcoma, margins were impossible to assess, but were likely positive.  She was evaluated by Dr. X and Dr. Y and a decision was made to proceed with preoperative chemotherapy.  She began treatment with CIVI-CAD in December 2007.  Her course was complicated by pulmonary embolus, pneumonia, and subdural hematoma while on anticoagulation.  She eventually underwent surgical resection on May 1, 2008 with small area of residual disease, but otherwise clear margins.,HOSPITAL COURSE:,1.  Leiomyosarcoma, the patient was admitted to Hem\/Onco B Service under attending Dr. XYZ for cycle six of continuous IV infusion Cytoxan, Adriamycin, and DTIC, which she tolerated well.,2.  History of pulmonary embolism.  Upon admission, the patient reported an approximate two-week history of dyspnea on exertion and some mild chest pain.  She underwent a CTA, which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism and the patient was started on prophylactic doses of Lovenox at 40 mg a day.  She had no further complaints throughout the hospitalization with any shortness of breath or chest pain.,3.  History of subdural hematoma, also on admission the patient noted some mild intermittent headaches that were fleeting in nature, several a day that would resolve on their own.  Her headaches were not responding to pain medication and so on 07\/24\/2008, we obtained a head CT that showed no evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.  The patient also had a history of sinusitis and so a sinus CT scan was obtained, which was normal.,4.  Pancytopenia.  On admission, the patient's white blood count was 3.4, hemoglobin 11.3, platelet count 82, and ANC of 2400.  The patient's counts were followed throughout admission.  She did not require transfusion of red blood cells or platelets; however, on 07\/26\/2008 her ANC did dip to 900 and she was placed on neutropenic diet.  At discharge her ANC is back up to 1100 and she is taken off neutropenic diet.  Her white blood cell count at discharge was 1.4 and her hemoglobin was 11.2 with a platelet count of 140.,5.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia.,4.  Hypertension.,5.  Congestive heart failure.,6.  Seizure disorder.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:,1.  Colonoscopy.,2.  Right hemicolectomy.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The patient is a 59-year-old female with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus requiring insulin for 26 years, previous MI and coronary artery disease, history of seizure disorder, GERD, bipolar disorder, and anemia.  She was admitted due to a seizure and myoclonic jerks as well as hypoglycemia and anemia.  Regarding the seizure disorder, Neurology was consulted.  Noncontrast CT of the head was negative.  Neurology felt that the only necessary intervention at that time would be to increase her Lamictal to 150 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening with gradual increase of the dosage until she was on 200 mg b.i.d.  Regarding the hypoglycemia, the patient has diabetic gastroparesis and was being fed on J-tube intermittent feedings throughout the night at the rate of 120 an hour.  Her insulin pump had a basal rate of roughly three at night during the feedings.  While in the hospital, the insulin pump rate was turned down to 1.5 and then subsequently decreased a few other times.  She seemed to tolerate the insulin pump rate well throughout her hospital course.  There were a few episodes of hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, but the episode seem to be related to the patient's n.p.o. status and the changing rates of tube feedings throughout her hospital course.,At discharge, her endocrinologist was contacted.  It was decided to change her insulin pump rate to 3 units per hour from midnight till 6 a.m., from 0.8 units per hour from 6 a.m. until 8 a.m., and then at 0.2 units per hour from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m.  The insulin was to be NovoLog.  Regarding the anemia, the gastroenterologists were consulted regarding her positive Hemoccult stools.  A colonoscopy was performed, which found a mass at the right hepatic flexure.  General Surgery was then consulted and a right hemicolectomy was performed on the patient.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and tube feeds were slowly restarted following the procedure, and prior to discharge were back at her predischarge rates of 120 per hour.  Regarding the cancer itself, it was found that 1 out of 53 nodes were positive for cancer.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no metastasis, a CT of the chest revealed possible lung metastasis.  Later in hospital course, the patient developed a septic-like picture likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia.  She was treated with Zosyn, Levaquin, and vancomycin, and tolerated the medications well.  Her symptoms decreased and serial chest x-rays were followed, which showed some resolution of the illness.

She was given a lab sheet to have a CBC with diff as well as a CMP to be drawn prior to her appointment with Dr. X.  She is instructed to follow up with Dr. Y if her condition changes regarding her colon cancer.  She was instructed to follow up with Dr. Z, her oncologist, regarding the positive lymph nodes.  We were unable to contact Dr. Z, but his telephone number was given to the patient and she was instructed to make a followup appointment.  She was also instructed to follow up with her endocrinologist, Dr. A, regarding any insulin pump adjustments, which were necessary and she was also instructed to follow up with Dr. B, her gastroenterologist, regarding any issues with her J-tube.,CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: , Stable.","233":"ADMISSION DIAGNOSES:,1.  Seizure.,2.  Hypoglycemia.,3.  Anemia.,4.  Hypotension.,5.  Dyspnea.,6.  Edema.,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Colon cancer, status post right hemicolectomy.,2.  Anemia.,3.  Hospital-acquired pneumonia.,4.  Hypertension.,5.  Congestive heart failure.,6.  Seizure disorder.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:,1.  Colonoscopy.,2.  Right hemicolectomy.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The patient is a 59-year-old female with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus requiring insulin for 26 years, previous MI and coronary artery disease, history of seizure disorder, GERD, bipolar disorder, and anemia.  She was admitted due to a seizure and myoclonic jerks as well as hypoglycemia and anemia.  Regarding the seizure disorder, Neurology was consulted.  Noncontrast CT of the head was negative.  Neurology felt that the only necessary intervention at that time would be to increase her Lamictal to 150 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening with gradual increase of the dosage until she was on 200 mg b.i.d.  Regarding the hypoglycemia, the patient has diabetic gastroparesis and was being fed on J-tube intermittent feedings throughout the night at the rate of 120 an hour.  Her insulin pump had a basal rate of roughly three at night during the feedings.  While in the hospital, the insulin pump rate was turned down to 1.5 and then subsequently decreased a few other times.  She seemed to tolerate the insulin pump rate well throughout her hospital course.  There were a few episodes of hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, but the episode seem to be related to the patient's n.p.o. status and the changing rates of tube feedings throughout her hospital course.,At discharge, her endocrinologist was contacted.  It was decided to change her insulin pump rate to 3 units per hour from midnight till 6 a.m., from 0.8 units per hour from 6 a.m. until 8 a.m., and then at 0.2 units per hour from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m.  The insulin was to be NovoLog.  Regarding the anemia, the gastroenterologists were consulted regarding her positive Hemoccult stools.  A colonoscopy was performed, which found a mass at the right hepatic flexure.  General Surgery was then consulted and a right hemicolectomy was performed on the patient.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and tube feeds were slowly restarted following the procedure, and prior to discharge were back at her predischarge rates of 120 per hour.  Regarding the cancer itself, it was found that 1 out of 53 nodes were positive for cancer.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no metastasis, a CT of the chest revealed possible lung metastasis.  Later in hospital course, the patient developed a septic-like picture likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia.  She was treated with Zosyn, Levaquin, and vancomycin, and tolerated the medications well.  Her symptoms decreased and serial chest x-rays were followed, which showed some resolution of the illness.  The patient was seen by the Infectious Disease specialist.  The Infectious Disease specialist recommended vancomycin to cover MRSA bacteria, which was found at the J-tube site.  At discharge, the patient was given three additional days of p.o. Levaquin 750 mg as well as three additional days of Bactrim DS every 12 hours.  The Bactrim was used to cover the MRSA at the J-tube site.  It was found that MRSA was sensitive to Bactrim.  Throughout her hospital course, the patient continued to receive Coreg 12.5 mg daily and Lasix 40 mg twice a day for her congestive heart failure, which remains stable.  She also received Lipitor for her high cholesterol.  Her seizure disorder remained stable and she was discharged on a dose of 100 mg in the morning and 150 mg at night.  The dosage increases can begin on an outpatient basis.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS\/MEDICATIONS: , The patient was discharged to home.  She was told to shy away from strenuous activity.

Anemia of chronic disease.,HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,The patient was admitted through the emergency room.  He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.  He was rewarmed and had blood, sputum, and urine cultures done.  He was placed on IV Rocephin.  His usual medications of Dilantin and Depakene were given.  The patient's hypertension was treated with fluid boluses.  The patient was empirically placed on Synthroid and hydrocortisone by Dr. X.  Blood work consisted of a chemistry panel that was unremarkable, except for decreased proteins.  H&H was stable at 33.3\/10.9 and platelets of 80,000.  White blood cell counts were normal, differential was normal.  TSH was 3.41.  Free T4 was 0.9.  Dr. X felt this was consistent with secondary hypothyroidism and recommended Synthroid replacement.  A cortisol level was obtained prior to administration of hydrocortisone.  This was 10.9 and that was not a fasting level.  Dr. X felt because of his hypothyroidism and his hypothermia that he had secondary adrenal insufficiency and recommended hydrocortisone and Florinef.  The patient was eventually changed to prednisone 2.5 mg b.i.d. in addition to his Florinef 0.1 mg on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  The patient was started back on his tube feeds.  He tolerated these poorly with residuals.  Reglan was increased to 10 mg q.6 h. and erythromycin is being added.  The patient's temperature has been stable in the 94 to 95 range.  Other vital signs have been stable.  His urine output has been diminished.  An external jugular line was placed in the Intensive Care Unit.  The patient's legal guardian, Janet Sanchez in Albuquerque has requested he be transported there.  As per several physicians in Albuquerque and Dr. Y, an internist, we will accept him once we have a nursing home available to him.  He is being transported back to the nursing home today and discharge planners are working on getting him a nursing home in Albuquerque.

This patient presented with periumbilical abdominal pain with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for the past 3 days and four to five watery bowel movements a day with symptoms progressively getting worse.  The patient was admitted into the ER and had trop x1 done, which was negative and ECG showed to be of normal sinus rhythm.,Lab findings initially presented with a hemoglobin of 13.1, hematocrit of 38.6 with no elevation of white count.  Upon discharge, his hemoglobin and hematocrit stayed at 10.9 and 31.3 and he was still having stool guaiac positive blood, and a stool study was done which showed few white blood cells, negative for Clostridium difficile and moderate amount of occult blood and moderate amount of RBCs.  The patient's nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea did resolve during his hospital course.  Was placed on IV fluids initially and on hospital day #2 fluids were discontinued and was started on clear liquid diet and diet was advanced slowly, and the patient was able to tolerate p.o. well.  The patient also denied any abdominal pain upon day of discharge.  The patient was also started on prednisone as per GI recommendations.  He was started on 60 mg p.o.

He was admitted to a regular bed. Dr. G of Urology was consulted for evaluation of his hematuria. During the workup for this, he had a CT of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast with early and late-phase imaging for evaluation of the kidneys and collecting system. At that time, he was shown to have multiple bilateral renal cysts with one that did not meet classification as a simple cyst and ultrasound was recommended.,He had an ultrasound done of the cyst which showed a 2.1 x 2.7 cm mass arising from the right kidney which, again, did not fit ultrasound criteria for a simple cyst and they recommended further evaluation by an MRI as this could be a hemorrhagic cyst or a solid mass or tumor, so an MRI was scheduled on the day of discharge for further evaluation of this. The report was not back at discharge. The patient had a cystoscopy and transurethral resection of prostate as well with entire resection of the prostate gland. Pathology on this specimen showed multiple portions of prostatic tissue which was primarily fibromuscular, and he was diagnosed with nonprostatic hyperplasia. His urine slowly cleared. He tolerated a regular diet with no difficulties in his activities of daily living, and his Foley was removed on the day of discharge.,He was started on ciprofloxacin, Colace, and Lasix after the transurethral resection and continued these for a short course. He is asked to continue the Colace as an outpatient for stool softening for comfort.,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:, Colace 100 mg 1 b.i.d.,DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP PLANNING:, The patient is to follow up with his primary care physician at ABCD, Dr. B or Dr. J, the patient is unsure of which, in the next couple weeks. He is to follow up with Dr. G of  Urology in the next week by phone in regards to the patient's MRI and plans for a laparoscopic partial renal resection biopsy. This is scheduled for the week after discharge potentially by Dr. G, and the patient will discuss the exact time later this week. The patient is to return to the emergency room or to our clinic if he has worsening hematuria again or no urine output.","465":"ADMITTING DIAGNOSES:,1. Hematuria.,2. Benign prostatic hyperplasia.,3.

Following his amputation, he had poor wound healing.  He presented to the ED with pain in his right lower extremity on July 9, 2008.  Due to concern for infection at that time, he was started on oral Keflex and instructed to follow up with the Vascular Clinic as scheduled.  At his follow-up appointment, it was decided to re-admit The patient for debridement and revision of his stump wound.,HOSPITAL COURSE:,  Briefly, The patient underwent extensive debridement of his right below-knee amputation wound on July 17, 2008.  He underwent debridement of skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscle, and bone to remove the necrotic tissue from the stump.  A wound VAC. was also placed to help accelerate wound healing.  The patient's postoperative course was complicated initially by acute blood-loss anemia, requiring blood transfusion.  He returned to the OR on Monday, July 21, 2008 for irrigation and debridement of his right below-knee amputation and a wound VAC change.  Again, on July 24, 2008, and then again on July 28, 2008, The patient returned to the operating room for irrigation and debridement of his wound and wound VAC change.  Following his procedure on July 28, 2008, The patient began having recurrent episodes of diarrhea, prompting stool cultures and C. difficile assay to be sent.  He was also started on Flagyl, empirically.  C. difficile assay returned positive and the decision was made to continue Flagyl for a full 14-day course.  On July 31, 2008, the patient began experiencing shortness of breath and wheezing after standing to be weighed.  His vital signs remained stable.  However, his oxygen saturation dropped to 93%, improving only to 97% after an addition of 2 liters by nasal cannula.  A chest x-ray revealed bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis in addition to some pulmonary edema diffusely.  The patient's IV fluids were decreased.  He was given p.r.n. albuterol and infusion of Lasix, resulting in significant urine output.  His symptoms of shortness of breath gradually improved.  On August 1, 2008, he returned to the OR for final irrigation and debridement of his below-knee amputation.  Again, a wound VAC was placed.  Postoperatively, he did well.  His Foley catheter was removed.  His vital signs remained stable, and his respiratory status also remained stable.

He was on TPN prior to coming to Hospital.  He has remained on TPN throughout his time here, but his appetite and his p.o. intake have improved some.  The patient had an episode while here where his blood pressure bottomed out requiring him to spend multiple days in the Intensive Care Unit on dopamine.  At one point, we were unsuccessful at weaning him off the dopamine, but after approximately 11 days, he finally started to tolerate weaning parameters, was successfully removed from dopamine, and has maintained his blood pressure without difficulty.  The patient also was requiring BiPAP to help with his oxygenation and it appeared that he developed a left-sided pneumonia.  This has been treated successfully with Zyvox and Levaquin and Diflucan.  He seems to be currently doing much better.  He is only using BiPAP in the evening.  As stated above, he is eating better.  He had some evidence of redness and exquisite swelling around his genital and lower abdominal region.  This may be mainly dependent edema versus anasarca.  The patient has been diuresed aggressively over the last 4 to 5 days, and this seems to have made some improvement in his swelling.  This morning, the patient denies any acute distress.

He was on TPN prior to coming to Hospital.  He has remained on TPN throughout his time here, but his appetite and his p.o. intake have improved some.  The patient had an episode while here where his blood pressure bottomed out requiring him to spend multiple days in the Intensive Care Unit on dopamine.  At one point, we were unsuccessful at weaning him off the dopamine, but after approximately 11 days, he finally started to tolerate weaning parameters, was successfully removed from dopamine, and has maintained his blood pressure without difficulty.

He seems to be currently doing much better.  He is only using BiPAP in the evening.  As stated above, he is eating better.  He had some evidence of redness and exquisite swelling around his genital and lower abdominal region.  This may be mainly dependent edema versus anasarca.

Acute kidney injury.,PROCEDURES DURING HOSPITALIZATION:,1.  Cycle five high-dose methotrexate.,2.  Rituxan weekly.,3.  Chest x-ray.,4.  Wound consult.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Ms. ABC is a pleasant 60-year-old Caucasian female who was diagnosed in April 2008 with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma after she developed visual saltation, changes, and confusion.  Further staging revealed borderline mediastinal pretracheal lymphadenopathy but was otherwise unremarkable.  She began high-dose methotrexate in mid May 2008; courses of methotrexate have been complicated by prolonged methotrexate levels, mental confusion, and mania.  During cycle three, repeat MRI showed interval worsening of disease, and Rituxan was added to her regimen.  Ms. ABC had a repeat MRI on July 24, 2008 prior to this admission, which showed significant improvement in her CNS disease.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , Ms. ABC was admitted to the Hematology B Service under attending Dr. Z.,1.  CNS lymphoma.  Upon admission, she was started on her Rituxan, which she tolerated well.  She was then hydrated with bicarbonate solution to a urine pH of 8.  She received methotrexate 5 g\/m2.  24-hour creatinine was 0.9, 48-hour methotrexate level was elevated at 2.08.  This was likely secondary to the need to initiate treatment with antibiotics secondary to infection.  Her leucovorin was increased to 100 mg\/m2.  72-hour methotrexate level was 0.58.  96-hour methotrexate was 0.16, and 19-hour was 0.08.  She continued additional four doses of oral leucovorin.  Her creatinine improved.  On day prior to discharge, she received her weekly dose of Rituxan.  She will return for Rituxan next week and then return for an appointment with Dr. X on August 18, 2008 with plans for admission for next cycle of methotrexate.,2.  Gram-negative bacteremia.  On the morning of June 27, 2008, Ms. ABC did spike a fever.  She was started on empiric antibiotics with cefepime and vancomycin.  Cultures were drawn peripherally and from the Port-A-Cath which both grew out Gram-negative rods within 12 hours.  After being initiated on IV antibiotics, she remained afebrile for the remainder of the hospitalization.  Both cultures eventually grew out Proteus mirabilis, which was pansensitive.  She had three additional blood cultures, which were all negative.  On the day prior to discharge, she was transitioned to oral Cipro and remained afebrile.  We had intended to send her home with oral antibiotics; however, by day of discharge, she was pancytopenic and it was decided that she should be discharged to complete a 14-day course of IV antibiotics with cefepime.  She will continue this with the assistance of home health services.  She was advised to follow neutropenic precautions and labs will be followed closely as an outpatient.  She understands if she develops a fever greater than 100.5, she should call to return immediately for admission.,3.  Pancytopenia.  On the day of discharge, the patient was pancytopenic with white count of 0.7, ANC of 500, hemoglobin 8.5, hematocrit 24.8, and platelet count 38, 000.  Her labs will be followed closely as an outpatient.  During the admission, we did obtain a HIT antibody, which was negative.  Heparin was held until this level was returned.  She was placed on Arixtra for prophylaxis against thrombus.  It is thought that her decreasing counts may be secondary to infection; however, if she continues to be pancytopenic, she will have a repeat bone marrow as an outpatient.,4.  Hypertension.  Blood pressure remained stable throughout the admission.  She will continue lisinopril daily.,5.  Perianal rash.  Upon admission, she was found to have worsening of a candidal rash in the perianal region.  A wound consult was obtained.  They recommended Aloe Vesta foam and Silver gel to the area topically.  She was also continued on Diflucan 200 mg daily.  She will complete a 10-day course.,6.  Diabetes mellitus.  At the time of admission, she was found to have hyperglycemia.  She was started on sliding scale insulin and eventually started on long-acting Lantus insulin.  She will be discharged with the regimen of Lantus 35 units at bedtime and continue the sliding scale as needed.,7.  Hypoxia.  She did have evidence of decreased saturations.  There was concern that she may have a pneumonia, which was treated with vancomycin for possible hospital acquired pneumonia; however, upon further review of the blood cultures improved, chest x-ray consistent with atelectasis and normal saturations that this was likely secondary to increased fluids associated with methotrexate and atelectasis from being confined to bed.,8.  Seizure prophylaxis.  She will continue Keppra twice daily.,9.  Acute kidney injury.  She did have a bump in the creatinine when methotrexate level was elevated.

History of anemia.,HISTORY AND HOSPITAL COURSE: , The patient is a 77-year-old white male who presented to Hospital of Bossier on April 14, 2008.  The patient was found to have lumbar diskitis and was going to require extensive antibiotic therapy, which was the cause of need for continued hospitalization.  He also needed to continue with dialysis and he needed to improve his rehabilitation.  The patient tolerated his medication well and he was going through rehab fairly well without any significant troubles.  He did have some bouts of issues with constipation on and off throughout his hospitalization, but this seemed to come under control with more aggressive management.

Briefly, the patient is a 10-year-old male who presented to the Hospital Emergency Department following an ATV accident.  He was an unhelmeted passenger on ATV when the driver lost control and the ATV rolled over throwing the passenger and the driver approximately 5 to 10 meters.  The patient denies any loss of consciousness.  He was not amnestic to the event.  He was taken by family members to the Iredell County Hospital, where he was initially evaluated.  Due to the extent of his injuries, he was immediately transferred to Hospital Emergency Department for further evaluation.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , Upon arrival in the Hospital Emergency Department, he was noted to have an open left humerus fracture.  No other apparent injuries.  This was confirmed with radiographic imaging showing that the chest and pelvis x-rays were negative for any acute injury and that the cervical spine x-ray was negative for fracture malalignment.  The left upper extremity x-ray did demonstrate an open left distal humerus fracture.  The orthopedic surgery team was then consulted and upon their evaluation, the patient was taken emergently to the operating room for surgical repair of his left humerus fracture.  In the operating room, the patient was prepared for an irrigation and debridement of what was determined to be an open type 3 subcondylar left distal humerus fracture.  In the operating room, his upper extremity was evaluated for neurovascular status and great care was taken to preserve these structures.  Throughout the duration of the procedure, the patient had a palpable distal radial pulse.  The orthopedic team then completed an open reduction and internal fixation of the left supracondylar humerus fracture.  A wound VAC was then placed over the wound at the conclusion of the procedure.  The patient tolerated this procedure well and was returned to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for postsurgical followup and monitoring.  His diet was advanced and his pain was controlled with pain medication.  The day following his surgery, the patient was evaluated for a potential for closed head injury given the nature of his accident and the fact that he was not wearing a helmet during his accident.  A CT of the brain without contrast showed no acute intracranial abnormalities moreover his cervical spine was radiographically and clinically cleared and his C-collar was removed at that point.  Once his C spine had been cleared and the absence of a closed head injury was confirmed.  The patient was then transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the General Floor bed.  His clinical status continued to improve and on July 26, 2008, he was taken back to the operating room for removal of the wound VAC and closure of his left upper extremity wound.  He again tolerated this procedure well on his return to the General Pediatrics Floor.  Throughout his stay, there was concern for compartment syndrome due to the nature and extent of his injuries.  However, frequent checks of his distal pulses indicated that he had strong peripheral pulses in the left upper extremity.  Moreover, the patient had no complaints of paresthesia.  There was no demonstration of pallor or pain on passive motion.  There was good capillary refill to the digits of the left hand.  By the date of the discharge, the patient was on a full pediatric select diet and was tolerating this well.  He had no abdominal tenderness and there were no abdominal injuries on exam or radiographic studies.  He was afebrile and his vital signs were stable and once cleared by Orthopedics, he was deemed appropriate for discharge.,PROCEDURES DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION:,1.

Briefly, the patient is a 10-year-old male who presented to the Hospital Emergency Department following an ATV accident.  He was an unhelmeted passenger on ATV when the driver lost control and the ATV rolled over throwing the passenger and the driver approximately 5 to 10 meters.  The patient denies any loss of consciousness.  He was not amnestic to the event.  He was taken by family members to the Iredell County Hospital, where he was initially evaluated.  Due to the extent of his injuries, he was immediately transferred to Hospital Emergency Department for further evaluation.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , Upon arrival in the Hospital Emergency Department, he was noted to have an open left humerus fracture.  No other apparent injuries.  This was confirmed with radiographic imaging showing that the chest and pelvis x-rays were negative for any acute injury and that the cervical spine x-ray was negative for fracture malalignment.  The left upper extremity x-ray did demonstrate an open left distal humerus fracture.  The orthopedic surgery team was then consulted and upon their evaluation, the patient was taken emergently to the operating room for surgical repair of his left humerus fracture.  In the operating room, the patient was prepared for an irrigation and debridement of what was determined to be an open type 3 subcondylar left distal humerus fracture.  In the operating room, his upper extremity was evaluated for neurovascular status and great care was taken to preserve these structures.  Throughout the duration of the procedure, the patient had a palpable distal radial pulse.  The orthopedic team then completed an open reduction and internal fixation of the left supracondylar humerus fracture.  A wound VAC was then placed over the wound at the conclusion of the procedure.  The patient tolerated this procedure well and was returned to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for postsurgical followup and monitoring.  His diet was advanced and his pain was controlled with pain medication.  The day following his surgery, the patient was evaluated for a potential for closed head injury given the nature of his accident and the fact that he was not wearing a helmet during his accident.  A CT of the brain without contrast showed no acute intracranial abnormalities moreover his cervical spine was radiographically and clinically cleared and his C-collar was removed at that point.  Once his C spine had been cleared and the absence of a closed head injury was confirmed.  The patient was then transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the General Floor bed.  His clinical status continued to improve and on July 26, 2008, he was taken back to the operating room for removal of the wound VAC and closure of his left upper extremity wound.  He again tolerated this procedure well on his return to the General Pediatrics Floor.  Throughout his stay, there was concern for compartment syndrome due to the nature and extent of his injuries.  However, frequent checks of his distal pulses indicated that he had strong peripheral pulses in the left upper extremity.  Moreover, the patient had no complaints of paresthesia.  There was no demonstration of pallor or pain on passive motion.  There was good capillary refill to the digits of the left hand.  By the date of the discharge, the patient was on a full pediatric select diet and was tolerating this well.  He had no abdominal tenderness and there were no abdominal injuries on exam or radiographic studies.  He was afebrile and his vital signs were stable and once cleared by Orthopedics, he was deemed appropriate for discharge.,PROCEDURES DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION:,1.

The patient has also been on high-dose prednisone for an urticarial rash.  The patient was admitted because of persistent high fevers without a clear-cut source of infection.  She had been having temperatures of up to 103 for 8-10 days.  She had been seen at Alta View Emergency Department a week prior to admission.  A workup there including chest x-ray, blood cultures, and a transthoracic echocardiogram had all remained nondiagnostic, and were normal.  Her chest x-ray on that occasion was normal.

These were localized to mid and lower lung zones.  The process was not diffuse.  There was no ground glass change.  CT abdomen and pelvis was normal.  Infectious disease consultation was obtained.  Dr. XYZ saw the patient.  He ordered serologies for CMV including a CMV blood PCR.  Next serologies for EBV, Legionella, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, Coccidioides, and cryptococcal antigen, and a PPD.

After the patient was seen in the office on August 10, she persisted with high fevers and was admitted on August 11 to Cottonwood Hospital.  Studies done at Cottonwood:  CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  Results:  CT chest showed mild bibasilar pleural-based interstitial changes.  These were localized to mid and lower lung zones.  The process was not diffuse.  There was no ground glass change.  CT abdomen and pelvis was normal.  Infectious disease consultation was obtained.  Dr. XYZ saw the patient.  He ordered serologies for CMV including a CMV blood PCR.  Next serologies for EBV, Legionella, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, Coccidioides, and cryptococcal antigen, and a PPD.  The CMV serology came back positive for IgM.  The IgG was negative.  The CMV blood PCR was positive, as well.  Other serologies and her PPD stayed negative.  Blood cultures stayed negative.,In view of the positive CMV, PCR, and the changes in her CAT scan, the patient was taken for a bronchoscopy.  BAL and transbronchial biopsies were performed.  The transbronchial biopsies did not show any evidence of pneumocystis, fungal infection, AFB.  There was some nonspecific interstitial fibrosis, which was minimal.  I spoke with the pathologist, Dr. XYZ and immunopathology was done to look for CMV.  The patient had 3 nucleoli on the biopsy specimens that stained positive and were consistent with CMV infection.

There were 2-3 additional tiny cysts in the right lobe.

For further details of the admission, please see the previously dictated history and physical.  ,HOSPITAL COURSE:,  Gram-negative rod bacteremia.  The patient was admitted to the hospital with suspicion of endocarditis given the fact that she had fever, septicemia, and Osler nodes on her fingers.  The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram as an outpatient, which was equivocal, but a transesophageal echocardiogram here in the hospital was normal with no evidence of vegetations.  The microbiology laboratory stated that the Gram-negative rod appeared to be anaerobic, thus raising the possibility of organisms like bacteroides.  The patient does have a history of congenital genitourinary abnormalities which were surgically corrected before the fifth grade.  We did a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which only showed some benign appearing cysts in the liver.  There was nothing remarkable as far as her kidneys, ureters, or bladder were concerned.  I spoke with Dr. XYZ of infectious diseases, and Dr. XYZ asked me to talk to the patient about any contact with animals, given the fact that we have had a recent outbreak of tularemia here in Utah.  Much to my surprise, the patient told me that she had multiple pet rats at home, which she was constantly in contact with.  I ordered tularemia and leptospirosis serologies on the advice of Dr. XYZ, and as of the day after discharge, the results of the microbiology still are not back yet.  The patient, however, appeared to be responding well to levofloxacin.  I gave her a 2-week course of 750 mg a day of levofloxacin, and I have instructed her to follow up with Dr. XYZ in the meantime.  Hopefully by then we will have a final identification and susceptibility on the organism and the tularemia and leptospirosis serologies will return.  A thought of ours was to add doxycycline, but again the patient clinically appeared to be responding to the levofloxacin.  In addition, I told the patient that it would be my recommendation to get rid of the rats.  I told her that if indeed the rats were carriers of infection and she received a zoonotic infection from exposure to the rats, that she could be in ongoing continuing danger and her children could also potentially be exposed to a potentially lethal infection.  I told her very clearly that she should, indeed, get rid of the animals.  The patient seemed reluctant to do so at first, but I believe with some coercion from her family, that she finally came to the realization that this was a recommendation worth following.,  ,DISPOSITION,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: , Activity is as tolerated.

The patient was admitted to the hospital with suspicion of endocarditis given the fact that she had fever, septicemia, and Osler nodes on her fingers.  The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram as an outpatient, which was equivocal, but a transesophageal echocardiogram here in the hospital was normal with no evidence of vegetations.  The microbiology laboratory stated that the Gram-negative rod appeared to be anaerobic, thus raising the possibility of organisms like bacteroides.  The patient does have a history of congenital genitourinary abnormalities which were surgically corrected before the fifth grade.  We did a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which only showed some benign appearing cysts in the liver.  There was nothing remarkable as far as her kidneys, ureters, or bladder were concerned.  I spoke with Dr. XYZ of infectious diseases, and Dr. XYZ asked me to talk to the patient about any contact with animals, given the fact that we have had a recent outbreak of tularemia here in Utah.  Much to my surprise, the patient told me that she had multiple pet rats at home, which she was constantly in contact with.  I ordered tularemia and leptospirosis serologies on the advice of Dr. XYZ, and as of the day after discharge, the results of the microbiology still are not back yet.  The patient, however, appeared to be responding well to levofloxacin.

Hypertension.,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Serotonin syndrome secondary to high doses of Prozac.,2.  Atypical chest pain with myocardial infarction ruled out.,3.  Diabetes mellitus.,4.  Hypertension.,5.  Diarrhea resolved.,ADMISSION SUMMARY: , The patient is a 53-year-old woman with history of hypertension, diabetes, and depression.  Unfortunately her husband left her 10 days prior to admission and she developed severe anxiety and depression.  She was having chest pains along with significant vomiting and diarrhea.  Of note, she had a nuclear stress test performed in February of this year, which was normal.  She was readmitted to the hospital to rule out myocardial infarction and for further evaluation.,ADMISSION PHYSICAL: , Significant for her being afebrile.  Apparently there was one temperature registered mildly high at 100.  Her blood pressure was 140\/82, heart rate 83, oxygen saturation was 100%.  She was tearful.  HEART:  Heart sounds were regular.  LUNGS:  Clear.  ABDOMEN:  Soft.  Apparently there were some level of restlessness and acathexia.  She was also pacing.,ADMISSION LABS:  ,Showed CBC with a white count of 16.9, hematocrit of 46.9, platelets 318,000.  She had 80% neutrophils, no bands.  UA on 05\/02 came out negative.  Chemistry panel shows sodium 138, potassium 3.5, creatinine 0.6, calcium 8.3, lactate 0.9, ALT was 39, AST 38, total bilirubin 0.6.  Her initial CK came out at 922.  CK-MB was low.  Troponin was 0.04.  She had a normal amylase and lipase.  Previous TSH few days prior was normal.  Chest x-ray was negative.,HOSPITAL COURSE:,1.  Serotonin syndrome.

Her symptoms progressed and she presented to the emergency room at Brighton Gardens where a chest x-ray revealed evolving right lobar infiltrate.  She was started on antibiotics.  Infectious Disease was consulted.  She was initially begun on vancomycin.  Blood, sputum, and urine cultures were obtained; the results of which were negative for infection.  She was switched to IV Levaquin and received IV Flagyl for possible C. diff colitis as well as possible cholecystitis.  During her hospital stay, she initially was extremely relatively hypotensive with mild symptoms and she became dizzy with upright positioning.  Her systolic blood pressure was 60-70 mmHg despite rather aggressive IV fluid management up to 250 mL an hour.  She was seen in consultation by Dr. Y who monitored her fluid and pulmonary treatment.  Due to some elevated liver function tests, she was seen in consultation by Dr. X.  An ultrasound was negative; however, she did undergo CT scan of the chest and abdomen and there was a suspicion of fluid circling the gallbladder.  A HIDA scan was performed and revealed no evidence of gallbladder dysfunction.  Liver functions were monitored throughout her stay and while elevated, did reduce to approximately 1.5 times normal value.  She also was seen in consultation by Infectious Disease who followed her for several days and agreed with current management of antibiotics.

She was switched to IV Levaquin and received IV Flagyl for possible C. diff colitis as well as possible cholecystitis.  During her hospital stay, she initially was extremely relatively hypotensive with mild symptoms and she became dizzy with upright positioning.  Her systolic blood pressure was 60-70 mmHg despite rather aggressive IV fluid management up to 250 mL an hour.  She was seen in consultation by Dr. Y who monitored her fluid and pulmonary treatment.  Due to some elevated liver function tests, she was seen in consultation by Dr. X.  An ultrasound was negative; however, she did undergo CT scan of the chest and abdomen and there was a suspicion of fluid circling the gallbladder.  A HIDA scan was performed and revealed no evidence of gallbladder dysfunction.  Liver functions were monitored throughout her stay and while elevated, did reduce to approximately 1.5 times normal value.  She also was seen in consultation by Infectious Disease who followed her for several days and agreed with current management of antibiotics.  Over her week-stay, the patient was moderately hypoxemic with room air pulse oximetry of 90%.  She was placed on incentive spirometry and over the succeeding days, she did have improved pulmonary function.,LABORATORY TESTS: , Initially revealed a white count of 13,000, however, approximately 24 hours following admission her white count stabilized and in fact remained normal throughout her stay.

He was then switched over to p.o. pain medicines and has required very little for adequate pain control.  By postoperative date #2, the patient had been out of bed and ambulating in the hallways.  The patient's only problem was with some mild diarrhea on postoperative days #3 and 4.  This was thought to be a result of his right hemicolectomy.  A C. diff toxin was sent and came back negative and he was started on Imodium to manage his diarrhea.  His post-splenectomy vaccines including pneumococcal, HiB, and meningococcal vaccines were administered during his hospitalization.,On the day of discharge, the patient was resting comfortably in the bed without complaints.

He was admitted to General Surgery C Service for a routine preoperative evaluation including baseline labs, bowel prep, urology consult for ureteral stent placement.  The patient was taken to the operative suite on MM\/DD\/YYYY and was first seen by Urology for a cystoscopy with bilateral ureteral stent placement.  Dr. XYZ performed an exploratory laparotomy, right hemicolectomy, cholecystectomy, splenectomy, omentectomy, and IPHC with mitomycin-C.  The procedure was without complications.  The patient was observed closely in the ICU for one day postoperatively for persistent tachycardia after extubation.  He was then transferred to the floor where he has done exceptionally well.,On postoperative day #2, the patient passed flatus and we were able to start a clear liquid diet.  We advanced him as tolerated to a regular health select diet by postoperative day #4.  His pain was well controlled throughout this hospitalization, initially with a PCA pump, which he very seldomly used.  He was then switched over to p.o. pain medicines and has required very little for adequate pain control.  By postoperative date #2, the patient had been out of bed and ambulating in the hallways.  The patient's only problem was with some mild diarrhea on postoperative days #3 and 4.  This was thought to be a result of his right hemicolectomy.  A C. diff toxin was sent and came back negative and he was started on Imodium to manage his diarrhea.  His post-splenectomy vaccines including pneumococcal, HiB, and meningococcal vaccines were administered during his hospitalization.,On the day of discharge, the patient was resting comfortably in the bed without complaints.  He had been afebrile throughout his hospitalization and his vital signs were stable.

Elevated liver function tests.,HOSPITAL COURSE:,  This is a 53-year-old African American male patient of Dr. X who was admitted through the emergency room.  He has been having some right hip pain and cough.  The patient had a CT scan of the chest, which revealed a left pleural effusion, extensive mediastinal mass, left hilar adenopathy, causing complete obstruction of the left lower lobe and the lingula and the left pulmonary vein, and the multiple nodules on the right side of his chest.  These were all consistent with metastatic disease.  He was thus also a suspicion for osseous metastatic disease involving the right scapula with a left large pleural effusion.  The patient had severe shortness of breath, chest pain, a left-sided chest tube was inserted, and pleural effusion was positive for malignant cells.  The history of right hip pain could be secondary to metastatic disease.  The patient underwent bronchoscopy, which is positive for non-small cell lung CA.  The patient was seen by various consultants.  The patient underwent respiratory failure, requiring intubation, mechanical ventilatory support.  He was extubated, but had to be re-intubated because of respiratory failure.  Had a long discussion with the patient's wife and other family members.  The patient was seen by Dr. Y.  The patient was not in a condition to undergo any kind of chemotherapy, being on the ventilator.  The patient progressively got deteriorated.

He presents to us for repair of the hiatal hernia and revision of the Nissen fundoplication.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , Mr. A was admitted to the adolescent floor by Brenner Children's Hospital after his procedure.  He was stable at that time.  He did complain of some nausea.  However, he did not have any vomiting at that time.  He had an NG tube in and was n.p.o.  He also had a PCA for pain management as well as Toradol.  On postoperative day #1, he complained of not being able to urinate, so a Foley catheter was placed.  Over the next several days, his hospital course proceeded as follows.  He continued to complain of some nausea; however, he did not ever have any vomiting.  Eventually, the Foley catheter was discontinued and he had excellent urine output without any complications.  He ambulated frequently.  He remained n.p.o. for three days.

The patient woke up at 7: 15 a.m. on March 26 with the sudden onset of right-sided weakness of his arm, hand, leg and foot and also with a right facial droop, right hand numbness on the dorsal side, left face numbness and slurred speech. The patient was brought by EMS to emergency room. The patient was normal before he went to bed the prior night. He was given aspirin in the ER. The CT of the brain without contrast did not show any changes. He could not have a CT with contrast because the machine was broken. He went ahead and had the MRI\/MRA of the brain and neck, which showed infarct involving the right basal ganglia and deep white matter of the left parietal lobe. Also, there is diffuse smooth narrowing of the left middle cerebral artery.,The patient was admitted to the MICU.,HOSPITAL COURSE PER PROBLEM LIST:,1. Acute cerebrovascular accident: The patient was not a candidate for tissue plasminogen activator. A neurology consult was obtained from Dr. S. She agrees with our treatment for this patient. The patient was on aspirin 325 mg and also on Zocor 20 mg once a day. We also ordered fasting blood lipids, which showed cholesterol of 165, triglycerides 180, HDL cholesterol 22, LDL cholesterol 107. Dr. Farber agreed to treat the risk factors, to not treat blood pressure for the first two weeks of the stroke. We put the patient on p.r.n. labetalol only for systolic blood pressure greater than 200, diastolic blood pressure greater than 120. The patient's blood pressure has been stable and he did not need any blood pressure medications. His right leg kept improving with increased muscle strength and it was 4-5\/5, however, his right upper extremity did not improve much and was 0-1\/5. His slurred speech has been improved a little bit. The patient started PT, OT and speech therapy on the second day of hospitalization. The patient was transferred out to a regular floor on the same day of admission based on his stable neurologic exam. Also, we added Aggrenox for secondary stroke prevention, suggested by Dr. F. Echocardiogram was ordered and showed normal left ventricular function with bubble study that was negative. Carotid ultrasound only showed mild stenosis on the right side. EKG did not show any changes, so the patient will be transferred to Siskin Rehabilitation Hospital today on Aggrenox for secondary stroke prevention. He will not need blood pressure treatment unless systolic is greater than 220, diastolic greater than 120, for the first week of his stroke. On discharge, on his neurologic exam, he has a right facial palsy from the eye below, he has right upper extremity weakness with 0-1\/5 muscle strength, right leg is 4-5\/5, improved slurred speech.,2. Hypertension: As I mentioned in item #1, see above, his blood pressure has been stable. This did not need any treatment.,3.

He underwent a massive resection of multiple subcutaneous abscesses, heroin remnants, which left massive huge open wounds to his right thigh and hip.  This led to a prolonged hospital course.

He reports that over the past month, he has been feeling lightheaded when standing and has had three syncopal episodes during this time with return of consciousness after several minutes. He reports this lightheadedness is made even worse when standing. He has had these symptoms almost daily over the past month. He denies any bowel or bladder loss, although he reports very little urine output secondary to his end-stage renal disease. He denied any palpitations, warmth, or diaphoresis, which is indicative of vasovagal syncope. There were no witnesses to his syncopal episodes. He also denied any clonic activity and no history of seizures. In the emergency room, the patient was given fluids and orthostatics were checked. At that time, orthostatics were negative; however, due to the fact that fluid had been given before, it is impossible to rule out orthostatic hypotension. The patient presented to the hospital on Coreg 12.5 mg b.i.d. and lisinopril 10 mg daily secondary to his hypertension, congestive heart failure with dilated cardiomyopathy and end-stage renal disease. Regarding his syncopal episodes, he was admitted with likely orthostatic hypotension. Cardiology was consulted and their recommendations were to reduce the lisinopril to 5 mg daily. At that time, the Coreg had been held secondary to hypotension. Cardiology also ordered a nuclear medicine myocardial perfusion stress test. Regarding the end-stage renal disease, Nephrology was consulted as the patient was due for hemodialysis treatment the day following admission. Nephrology was able to perform dialysis on the patient and Renal concurred that the presyncopal symptoms were likely due to decreased intravascular volume in the postdialytic time frame. Renal agreed with decreasing his lisinopril to 5 mg daily and decreasing the Coreg to 6.25 mg b.i.d. They reported that the Procrit should be continued. As previously indicated regarding the dilated cardiomyopathy, Cardiology ordered a nuclear medicine stress test to be performed. Also, regarding the patient's hypertension, he actually was noted to have hypotension on admission, and as previously stated, the Coreg was originally discontinued and then it was restarted at 6.25 mg b.i.d. and the patient tolerated this well. The patient's hospital course remained uncomplicated until September 17, 2007, the day the nuclear medicine stress test was scheduled.

At the onset of therapy, on 03\/26\/08, the patient was NPO with a G-tube and the initial speech and language evaluation revealed global aphasia with an aphasia quotient of 3.6\/100 based on the Western Aphasia Battery. Since the initial evaluation, the patient has attended 60 outpatient speech therapy sessions, which have focussed on her receptive communication, expressive language, multimodality communication skills, and swallowing function and safety.\n\n1. The patient met 3 out of 4 original short-term therapy goals, which were to complete a modified barium swallow study, which she did do and which revealed no aspiration. At this time, the patient is eating and drinking and taking all medications by mouth; however, her G-tube is still present. The patient was instructed to talk to the primary care physician about removal of her feeding tube.\n2. The patient will increase accuracy of yes-no responses to greater than 80% accuracy. She did accomplish this goal. The patient is also able to identify named objects with greater than 80% accuracy.\n3. Following the completion of these goals, additional goals were established. Based on reevaluation, the patient met 2 out of these 3 initial goals and she is currently able to read and understand simple sentences with greater than 90% accuracy independently and she is able to write 10 words related to basic wants and needs with greater than 80% accuracy independently. The patient continues to have difficulty stating verbally, yes or no, to questions as well as accurately using head gestures and to respond to yes-no questions. The patient continues to have marked difficulty with her expressive language abilities. She is able to write simple words to help express her basic wants and needs. She has made great strides; however, with her receptive communication, she is able to read words as well as short phrases and able to point to named objects and answer simple-to-moderate complex yes-no questions. A reevaluation completed on 12\/01\/08, revealed an aphasia quotient of 26.4. Once again, she made significant improvement and comprehension, but continues to have unintelligible speech. An alternative communication device was discussed with the patient and her husband, but at this time, the patient does not want to utilize a communication device.

Goldenhar syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by defects in the development of the ear, face, and other structures on one side of the body, and gastroesophageal reflux is a condition in which the contents of the stomach back up into the esophagus due to a weak or defective lower esophageal sphincter. The two conditions can occur together as a result of a genetic mutation.","414":"The patient is a 10-week-old female infant with Goldenhar syndrome, gastroenteritis, severe gastroesophageal reflux, past history of aspiration and aspiration pneumonia, and anemia, likely due to iron deficiency. She has a G-tube and a J-tube in place, and has been prescribed Pepcid and Reglan to increase bowel motility.

She is currently stable and will be transported for further diagnosis and treatment.","415":"Based on the patient's presenting symptoms and physical examination, it is likely that the patient's primary diagnosis is gastroenteritis. Gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the lining of the stomach and small intestine caused by a virus, bacteria, or parasite. It is typically characterized by nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. The patient's past history of aspiration and aspiration pneumonia, as well as her dysmorphic facial features and torticollis, suggest that she may have Goldenhar syndrome as well. Goldenhar syndrome is a rare congenital disorder that affects the development of the ear, eye, and facial structures. The patient's abnormal red blood cell morphology, increased WBC count, and decreased bowel sounds suggest that she may also have an underlying infection. It is likely that the patient will require further evaluation and treatment for both her gastroenteritis and Goldenhar syndrome.","416":"The patient was initially seen in the emergency department on October 13, 2003 with vomiting, probable secondary to gastroenteritis, Goldenhar syndrome, severe gastroesophageal reflux, past history of aspiration and aspiration pneumonia, and anemia, probably iron deficiency.

Feedings were re-attempted with Pedialyte through the J-tube and these did not result in production of any stool and the child began vomiting again.  The vomitus was noted to be bilious in nature and with particulate matter present.  After consultation with Dr. X, it was determined the child needed further evaluation, and she had both of her drains placed to gravity and was kept n.p.o.  Her fluids have been D5 and 0.25 normal saline with 20 mEq\/L of potassium chloride, which has run at her maintenance of 16 mL\/h.

He stated that he never had blood in his urine before, however, he does have a past history of BPH and he had a transurethral resection of prostate more than 10 years ago. He was admitted to a regular bed. Dr. G of Urology was consulted for evaluation of his hematuria. During the workup for this, he had a CT of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast with early and late-phase imaging for evaluation of the kidneys and collecting system. At that time, he was shown to have multiple bilateral renal cysts with one that did not meet classification as a simple cyst and ultrasound was recommended. \nHe had an ultrasound done of the cyst which showed a 2.1 x 2.7 cm mass arising from the right kidney which, again, did not fit ultrasound criteria for a simple cyst and they recommended further evaluation by an MRI as this could be a hemorrhagic cyst or a solid mass or tumor, so an MRI was scheduled on the day of discharge for further evaluation of this. The report was not back at discharge. The patient had a cystoscopy and transurethral resection of prostate as well with entire resection of the prostate gland. Pathology on this specimen showed multiple portions of prostatic tissue which was primarily fibromuscular, and he was diagnosed with nonprostatic hyperplasia. His urine slowly cleared.

The orthopedic team then completed an open reduction and internal fixation of the left supracondylar humerus fracture. A wound VAC was then placed over the wound at the conclusion of the procedure. The patient tolerated this procedure well and was returned to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for postsurgical followup and monitoring. His diet was advanced and his pain was controlled with pain medication. The day following his surgery, the patient was evaluated for a potential for closed head injury given the nature of his accident and the fact that he was not wearing a helmet. A CT of the brain without contrast showed no acute intracranial abnormalities moreover his cervical spine was radiographically and clinically cleared and his C-collar was removed at that point. Once his C spine had been cleared and the absence of a closed head injury was confirmed. The patient was then transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the General Floor bed. His clinical status continued to improve and on July 26, 2008, he was taken back to the operating room for removal of the wound VAC and closure of his left upper extremity wound. He again tolerated this procedure well on his return to the General Pediatrics Floor. Throughout his stay, there was concern for compartment syndrome due to the nature and extent of his injuries.

He ordered serologies for CMV including a CMV blood PCR. Next serologies for EBV, Legionella, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, Coccidioides, and cryptococcal antigen, and a PPD. The CMV serology came back positive for IgM. The IgG was negative. The CMV blood PCR was positive, as well. Other serologies and her PPD stayed negative. Blood cultures stayed negative. In view of the positive CMV, PCR, and the changes in her CAT scan, the patient was taken for a bronchoscopy. BAL and transbronchial biopsies were performed. The transbronchial biopsies did not show any evidence of pneumocystis, fungal infection, AFB. There was some nonspecific interstitial fibrosis, which was minimal. I spoke with the pathologist, Dr. XYZ and immunopathology was done to look for CMV. The patient had 3 nucleoli on the biopsy specimens that stained positive and were consistent with CMV infection.

The patient has a history of congenital genitourinary abnormalities which were surgically corrected before the fifth grade. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed some benign appearing cysts in the liver. There was nothing remarkable as far as her kidneys, ureters, or bladder were concerned.

Much to my surprise, the patient told me that she had multiple pet rats at home, which she was constantly in contact with. I ordered tularemia and leptospirosis serologies on the advice of Dr. XYZ, and as of the day after discharge, the results of the microbiology still are not back yet.

Hopefully by then we will have a final identification and susceptibility on the organism and the tularemia and leptospirosis serologies will return. A thought of ours was to add doxycycline, but again the patient clinically appeared to be responding to the levofloxacin. In addition, I told the patient that it would be my recommendation to get rid of the rats. I told her that if indeed the rats were carriers of infection and she received a zoonotic infection from exposure to the rats, that she could be in ongoing continuing danger and her children could also potentially be exposed to a potentially lethal infection. I told her very clearly that she should, indeed, get rid of the animals.

It is a type of respiratory therapy used to treat certain breathing disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). In BI-PAP, two pressures are used: an inspiratory pressure (I-PAP) and an expiratory pressure (E-PAP). The inspiratory pressure is higher than the expiratory pressure, so that when the patient inhales, the air pressure in the lungs is increased and when the patient exhales, the air pressure is decreased. This helps to keep the airway open and make breathing easier.","702":"The patient was intubated and ventilated from January 29 to February 6, 2006.","703":"There are potential interactions between the prescribed medications.

Her symptoms progressed and she presented to the emergency room at Brighton Gardens where a chest x-ray revealed evolving right lobar infiltrate.  She was started on antibiotics.  Infectious Disease was consulted.  She was initially begun on vancomycin.  Blood, sputum, and urine cultures were obtained; the results of which were negative for infection.  She was switched to IV Levaquin and received IV Flagyl for possible C. diff colitis as well as possible cholecystitis.  During her hospital stay, she initially was extremely relatively hypotensive with mild symptoms and she became dizzy with upright positioning.  Her systolic blood pressure was 60-70 mmHg despite rather aggressive IV fluid management up to 250 mL an hour.  She was seen in consultation by Dr. Y who monitored her fluid and pulmonary treatment.  Due to some elevated liver function tests, she was seen in consultation by Dr. X.  An ultrasound was negative; however, she did undergo CT scan of the chest and abdomen and there was a suspicion of fluid circling the gallbladder.  A HIDA scan was performed and revealed no evidence of gallbladder dysfunction.  Liver functions were monitored throughout her stay and while elevated, did reduce to approximately 1.5 times normal value.  She also was seen in consultation by Infectious Disease who followed her for several days and agreed with current management of antibiotics.  Over her week-stay, the patient was moderately hypoxemic with room air pulse oximetry of 90%.
