<p>We present <strong>CAMEL</strong>, <strong>C</strong>linically <strong>A</strong>dapted <strong>M</strong>odel <strong>E</strong>nhanced from <strong>L</strong>LaMA. As LLama for its foundation, <strong>CAMEL</strong> is further pre-trained on MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and i2b2 clinical notes and fine-tuned over clinical instructions. Our preliminary evaluation with GPT-4 assessment, demonstrates that <strong>CAMEL</strong> achieves over 96% of the quality of OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 (see Figure 1). In accordance with the data usage policies of our source data, both our instruction dataset and model will be published on PhysioNet with credentialized access. To facilitate replication, we will also release all code, allowing individual healthcare institutions to reproduce our model using their own clinical notes.</p>

<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>Large language models, such as OpenAI’s GPT-series, have demonstrated promising results in tackling clinical tasks, including <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16416">entity</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12689">extraction</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11032">de-identification</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07356">medical record summarization</a>. Despite their potential, the API-based nature of these models introduces significant privacy concerns, limiting their widespread adoption in real-world healthcare settings. Healthcare professionals require a model that can support their clinical decision-making while alleviating privacy concerns.</p>
<p>In response to the growing demand for privacy-preserving AI solutions in healthcare, we release <strong>CAMEL-7B</strong>, a new clinical large language model that has been further pretrained with clinical notes (3.4B tokens) and fine-tuned on 100K clinical instructions over <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971">LLaMa</a> (Figure 2). Our results show that <strong>CAMEL-7B</strong> can achieve similar performance (96% score measured by GPT4) to GPT-3.5 on 13 tasks over previously unseen clinical notes.</p>
<p>In this study, we utilized both MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and i2b2 notes to pretrain the model and generate instruction-following dataset. In compliance with the usage regulations outlined by <a href="https://physionet.org/about/">PhysioNet</a>, both the dataset employed for model training and the resulting model weights will be uploaded to their platform for credentialized access.</p>

<h1 id="instruction-generation">Instruction Generation</h1>
<p>In clinical domain, particularly concerning clinical notes, there exists a set of tasks that healthcare professionals frequently ask for. In this study, we introduce 13 pre-determined natural language processing (NLP) tasks specifically designed for application to clinical notes. These tasks were derived from a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00730-6">survey</a> conducted on clinical NLP tasks in the UK between 2007 and 2022, and by examining the tools employed in the <a href="https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/">healthcare industry</a> for clinical practices. The following table delineates each of the 13 task types.</p>

<p>Drawing upon the inspiration from <a href="https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca">Alpaca’s approach</a> to instruction generation utilizing Text-davinci-003, we adapted this methodology for the generation of clinical instructions. We constructed a dataset consisting of 9,000 clinical discharge summaries, sourced from the <a href="https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/">MIMIC-III</a>, <a href="https://physionet.org/content/mimic-iv-note/2.2/">MIMIC-IV</a>, and <a href="https://www.i2b2.org/NLP/DataSets/">i2b2</a> repositories. In adherence to the <a href="https://physionet.org/news/post/415">data usage regulations</a> prescribed by Physionet, we utilized Microsoft Azure’s HIPAA-compliant GPT-3.5 language model to produce a single question for each pre-defined task and corresponding answer. The final instruction dataset encompasses 100k instructions, generated at a cost of under $100 via the OpenAI API. To facilitate replication of our work by clinical institutions with their own clinical notes, we have made the requisite code accessible through the following <a href="https://github.com/starmpcc/CAMEL">link</a>.</p>

<h1 id="training">Training</h1>
<h2 id="clinical-notes-pre-training">Clinical Notes Pre-training</h2>
<p>Recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.14454.pdf">study</a> has explored the enhancement of the LLaMA model by employing additional casual language model pretraining on PubMed articles with the aim of injecting biomedical knowledge into the model. Similarly, to further familiarize our model with the unique characteristics of clinical notes, such as the prevalent use of abbreviations, non-standard grammar, and unexplained jargon, further pretraining was conducted on the entire MIMIC-III (1.3 billion tokens) and MIMIC-IV (2.1 billion tokens) notes. This process took about 200 hours on eight A6000 48GB GPU. The effectiveness of clinical pretraining will be demonstrated in the evaluation results presented below.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="clinical-instruction-finetuning">Clinical Instruction Finetuning</h2>
<p>After pretraining the model with clinical notes, we further finetune the model with instructions that the healthcare professionals might ask about. We employed the training schema devised by <a href="https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-03-30-vicuna/">Vicuna</a>, which builds upon Alpaca framework. This adaptation involved extending the maximum context length to 2,048 tokens, while also incorporating gradient checkpointing mechanisms to optimize memory usage. For a comprehensive understanding of the methodology, we kindly direct readers to consult the respective repositories of <a href="https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca">Alpaca</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat">Vicuna</a>.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h1 id="preliminary-evaluation">Preliminary Evaluation</h1>
<p>For the fair evaluation of <strong>CAMEL-7B,</strong> we utilized <a href="https://www.mtsamples.com/index.asp">MTSamples</a> (a publically available clinical note dataset designated for research and educational purposes) that had not been used during the training process. We constructed an evaluation dataset by extracting 1,000 question-answer pairs from 108 MTSamples discharge summary notes. Informed by the evaluation approach in Vicuna, we asked GPT-4 to rate the responses of models (Alpaca, <strong>CAMEL</strong>, and GPT-3.5) on a scale of 1 to 10, based on the relevance and accuracy of their responses (which costs less than 50$).  Additionally, we present GPT-4’s responses for ease of comparison (refer to the three examples provided below).</p>

<h2 id="is-clinical-note-pretraining-needed">Is clinical note pretraining needed?</h2>
<p>To validate the efficacy of clinical note pretraining, we compare <strong>CAMEL</strong> (note pretrained + instruction finetuned over LLaMA) to <strong>CAMEL without note pretraining</strong> (only instruction finetuned over LLaMA).  As in the table above, we can observe that the score decreased without clinical note pretraining. However, the difference is not substantial, and we believe that the clinical notes from the MTSample notes are written with plain languages compared to MIMIC notes.</p>

<ol>
 <li>Of the various types of clinical notes, such as nursing notes, physician notes, and radiology notes, only discharge summaries were employed in our work. We plan to expand the scope of the data in the near future.</li>
 <li>We plan to upscale the model size using LLaMa-13B and beyond.</li>
 <li>Beyond GPT4 evaluation, a more refined evaluation of the model will be conducted by getting feedback from actual medical professionals.</li>
 <li>As this <a href="https://github.com/Instruction-Tuning-with-GPT-4/GPT-4-LLM">study</a> demonstrated that the enhanced performance was observed when finetuning with answers provided by GPT-4, we intend to conduct a similar experiment employing a HIPAA-certified GPT-4 model.</li>
 <li>Rather than merely engaging in a question-and-answer format with the model, our research aims to expand its capabilities by enabling dialog with the model.</li>
</ol>

<p>We plan to update limitations and license after uploading the model on physionet.</p>
